"canon 30d and 40d are way sexier might upgrade later after i build a nice lens collection","Positive"
"i though about upgrating to a different camera xti 30d nikon d40x even nikon d200 but really have no need for it it would almost be a waste for my needs and in my case money is almost no matter how ever i could just not justify purchasing something else","Neutral"
"i didnt see the need to go up to the xti nikon d40x nikon d80 because at 8 mp you can pretty much blow the xt pictures up to poster size and not really see huge loss in detail","Neutral"

"br i would have to say lack of spot metering does give the nikon d70 an advantage but this camera does have a center metering mode with exposure lock so it is not really a showstopper","Negative"
"eventhough i love my old digital rebel with upgraded firmware i think i want to add this to my canon collection rather than 20d","Positive"
