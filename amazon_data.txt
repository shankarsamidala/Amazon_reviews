canon 30d and 40d are way sexier might upgrade later after i build a nice lens collection
i though about upgrating to a different camera xti 30d nikon d40x even nikon d200 but really have no need for it it would almost be a waste for my needs and in my case money is almost no matter how ever i could just not justify purchasing something else
i didnt see the need to go up to the xti nikon d40x nikon d80 because at 8 mp you can pretty much blow the xt pictures up to poster size and not really see huge loss in detail
other canon cameras i own include the canon eos 10s the eos rebel g2 the eos elan 7 the eos rebel digital 63 mp and now the eos rebel digital xt
to 40d right before 50d was announced thanks alot canon af is so much better on the 40d
br the canon came out on top in all catergories with the exception of a few at the time such as price because of the nikon d50 though the rebels other features clearly outway the nikon
this camera is one of the smallest sized dslrsfeels good in hands compared to nikon d70s etc
of this camera is lower than the counterpart of other brands ie nikon d70s therefore it is not so suprise about the problems i mentions above
i am a professional photographer and i own a canon 20d as well
of course some very real differences between the eos digital rebel xt digital camera and the more advanced eos 20d
was very impressed with the 20d but the price difference could easily give me a very good lense and the feature differences are minor so rebel xt it is i am a photography enthuiast who wishes he had the budget for a canon 1d markii but instead have the budget of a mortal and have to pay for a personal camera out of his own pocket
br i would have to say lack of spot metering does give the nikon d70 an advantage but this camera does have a center metering mode with exposure lock so it is not really a showstopper
eventhough i love my old digital rebel with upgraded firmware i think i want to add this to my canon collection rather than 20d
the camera body is the cheapest part of the camera youre likely to purchase and its really the easiest to make a decision on go to a store pick up a rebel pick up a d80 the nikon more or less equivalent and decide which feels right
so if you see yourself taking a lot of photos in low light you might as well get the canon 30d body for 650 the price as of nowsept 2008
if the price doesnt go down buy a nikon d60 cheaper or canon xsi same price as the xt and way more advanced
or best yet buy a canon 30d and buy the lens separate

i highly recommend looking at olympus when it come time to buy a dslr and the e300 is def a fav of mine
i have used both the nikon d70 and canon 20d and i prefer the olympus over them both
br bottom line consensus the evolt 300 is a technically sound and accomplished dslr which delivers quality photographs comparable to the nikon d70 and superior to the canon digital rebel xt
br unlike the similarly priced nikon d50 and the canon xt the evolt 300 does not feel or handle like a cheap plastic toy
if money were no object id say buy the canon eos 20d
i hope olympus that you will come up with better product in evolt e500 but please make and assemble it in japan
but having batteries familiarity with the menu system and really very good experience with olympus products and service over the years i took the plunge and got the e300 and its kit lens
br these few drawbacks are not enough to keep you from saving 800900 off of the canon 20d for the same image quality
the olympus won me over with some neat features on the e300 that i really liked
after using this camera and the d300 yes this one is better than the d300 and dozens of other professionals i know say the same i have converted to being a nikon girl
i got the d2x last august knowing full well that a replacement for the d100 which turned out to be the nikon d200 was eminent
but if youre looking for a great studio camera the d1x wont let you down and if youre just getting into dslrs the d50 d70 are great bodies to get started on
i now primarily use a nikon d90 which is mind blowing for its price but i would still never get rid of my d50
br based on what i read about it the d50 was a good choice for me i have been exhibiting my photos on an off for years enjoy being able to switch from auto to manual mode and as an artist and nikon afficionado i decided that id be comfortable with this camera and i was not wrong
br the nikon d50 61mp digital slr camera with 2880mm f3356g af nikkor zoom lens camera is a pleasure to own and use
i happened to have an old nikon n2020 slr with a half dozen almost new in the box nikkor af lenses circa 1986every one of them work great with my d50 body
the manual is a tome but after you try and read it buy nikon d50 digital field guide paperback by david d busch which helped me a lot as i havent used an slr in a long time and need to be retrained
each and every trip in ca is wonderful and with nikon d50 it is really breath taking snaps
br enjoy nikon d50 if u have it
think of it this way the next nikon model that presently has the ability to use this old legacy of lens is the nikon d80 making it and advanced feature
br in conclusion i believe that if you buy the nikon d40 and you improved as a photographer you may feel necessary to upgrade to a more advanced body
personally the ideal starter kit is nikon d50 2g fast sd card sigma 1020mm nikon 18200 vr f3556 the nikon 50mm f18 to compensate low light conditions due to the wonderful f18 and a nikon sb600 flashlight
br like so many others looking for a good entrylevel dslr camera probably have i easily narrowed my selection down to the canon digital rebel 350 and the nikon d50
both my brotherinlaw and my niece are excellent photographers and i have admired their nikon digital slrs he has a d400 she has a d70 for a while now and have kept informing everyone that i wanted to get one
with the nikon d50 it is very easy to take wonderful action shots
also the 18135 that nikon sells with the d80 looks good to me but they dont make a kit with those lenses for the d50
nikon d50 is an absolutely fantastic camera
in addition to the advantages of digital the camera can hold 300 high quality photos and the use of all lenses made for the nikon slr is the very good quality of the pictures and the ease of handling in the nonauto mode
well one day while shopping at the px i am in afghanistan i noticed the nikon d50 package for 670 tax free i decided what the hay i might as well buy it i have wanted a digital slr forever all i can say is i am not disappointed moderately confused but not disappointed
if you want take pictures like a prof dont thik about it buy the nikon d50 and enjoy the moments
br but the nikon d50 is a superb camera
before i bought the nikon d50 with kit lens ive done a most extensive research in finding the best dslr at the moment
br also the nikon d50 has won the diwa gold award for excellent value for money and the diwa platinum award for the best digital camera system
a book like the nikon d50 field guide with its practice pictures is also helpful
in 02 i went digital with a small canon s30 ps that camera got me a lot of great pictures but id take out the n70 every now and then because it took so much better pictures
i noticed the shutter time was much quicker then with my kodak camera plus i am able to take my quantrary lens 55300 from my nikon n65 film camera and put it on my nikon d50 and still get great pictures
i worked it down to the d50 the d70s and the canon digital rebel
i had the benefit of a friend with a d70 and was able to handle that camera extensively before my purchase
my firstdigital was a finepix 14 megapixels then a 41 and now my first digital slr nikon d50 just perfect for novice slr users looking for a nice handly camera to shoot creative photos
buying the nikon d50 dslr has rekindled my passion for photography
i purchased my nikon at best buy because i wanted a hands on with the canon rebel xt and nikon d50
the canon is heavy and the lenses are much larger in diameter as opposed to the nikon with the d50 its lightweight and the lenses are a petite size which will not make you feel like you are holding and extremely large unecessarily bulky camera
br i highly recommend anyone who is a novice and wanting to delve into photography for a serious hobby or even for the fun of just having a great camera should consider the nikon d50
here is my review of the nikon d50 the best digital camera i ever owned
dont even think about going for the canon rebel xt because the nikon d50 is cheaper and is the best camera you can get for the money on the market
the nikon d50 is a superb digital slr camera that really can do it all
yes nikon deviated from its usual commitment to the cf format and the d50 uses the sd format
the rebel has more megipixels than the d50 but i like the larger and solid feel that the nikon has
br the nikon d50 works well with my mac os x and iphoto with out having to use a card reader
i recently upgraded from a panasonic lumix dmcfz20 to the nikon d50 and it was definitely worth the investment
the nikon d40 was also in the running but because i had friends and other family with this canon xt i thought i could get more help if i ran into trouble with it
tried olympus evolt e500 and the auto white balance on it was worse
apparently canon realized theres a problem with the eos 350ds focus system because the new eos 400d rebel xti comes with a different sensor its the same highly accurate ninepoint diamond shaped focus sensor thats found on the considerably more expensive professional grade eos 30d
a friend of mine has a canon 20d and it is a better camera but only slightly and costs 50000 more
the new canon eos digital rebel xt offers many of the same exposure features and improvements as the 10d but slightly scaled back to keep costs under control
it is not as popular as ccd but the future promises us even better digicams based on cmos sensors due to the lower amount of power consumption versus the typical ccd device sensor very similar to that on the canon eos 10d as well as most of the same exposure features
bought this camera after reviewing it against the nikon d50
br this is a great camera for those wanting to switch to a digital slr but do not have the extra for the canon 20d or some of the other choices out there
my family loves nikon and during my search for a digital camera it was difficult passing over the nikon d70 but only initially
i chose up this canon product for two major reasons first nikon d70 was not available at that time and second digital rebel xt lense efs1785mm is usm seemed to be better and affordable choice
the jpeg pictures i didnt try raw looked excellent on the sony lcd screen on par with the more expensive eos 20d dslr
i owned the 60 mp canon eos rebel 300d which was canons first digital slr for several years until an internal mirror latch broke and for just a little more than it would have cost to fix i purchased refurbished the next model up which is the 350d or eos rebel xt
quality is close to the more expensive eos 20d
the nikon d40 was also in the running but because i had friends and other family with this canon xt i thought i could get more help if i ran into trouble with it
tried olympus evolt e500 and the auto white balance on it was worse

the jpeg pictures i didnt try raw looked excellent on the sony lcd screen on par with the more expensive eos 20d dslr
when i was unwilling to pay the price i took a serious look at the olympus e300
i was always very happy and satisfied with quality and reliability of olympus products thats why i am still in schock that e300 evolt was such a disappointment
i have by nature been very weary of the digital slrs even though i sell tons of them every week i have used the canon xt and 20d and the nikon d70 consistantly
as i said i am a professional photographer and i sell cameras and aside from some bells and whistles speed youll never use the e300 is everybit as good a digital slr camera as its canon and nikon counterparts more so in some waysthe biggest being price
i received the olympus e300 evolt for christmas and i am extremely happy with the cameras performance
while newer cameras like the d90 and up into the way more expensive professional models current in 2010 have technically better image quality the d50 is kind of like a digital holga for me as any good photographer knows megapixels dont mean jack sh beyond getting somewhat more detail in huge printsa medium format film camera doesnt take inherently better images than a 35mm film camera unless there is an objective goal of more detail in the final large print
its reliable and simple to use and unlike the very newest nikon cameras d40 d60 etc it will focus with the older screw drive autofocus lenses
switching to the nikon d50 was like going from a horse and buggy to a ferrari
this lens one of the best you can ever get for your nikon digital or film and although fullyfunctional on the nikon d50 i will not auto focus on d40x
so long story short i was in desperate need of and long overdue for some more control over my picture taking and i found it in the nikon d50
note that this capability is not possible with the nikon d40 because the d40 does not have an internal autofocus motor which is necessary for all but the newest lenses
i have many photographer friends who use the more expensive canon 20d and they have all been impressed by this cameras point and shoot auto program capabilities
a new d40 has been announced over the past few days but its lack of an lcd display and buttons to manage basic camera controls to reduce weight and make it more user friendly would still make this my recommended nikon dslr
i never had a digital slr before the camera i had before the d50 was a nikon coolpix a compact one
the nikon d50 is the companys entrylevel digital slr with a lot to like including simplified operation improved high iso performance and lots of features for one of the lowest prices of any camera in this class
br first of all it was less expensive though it seemed to miss some features that the canon or nikon d70s had but that i considered to be of minor importance to me
so my first digital camera was the kodak easy share which is a great point and shoot camera but i wanted something more challenging in digital photography so i decided to try the nikon d50 which i feel in love with it the moment i was able to take my first photograph with it
the nikon d50 was one of the few items i have ever bought where i went in somewhat skeptical and wound up being pleased more than i could imagine
br i would say instead of getting a d70 and an 1870 get a d50 and one of those swank 18200s from nikon which is totally cool although you will wait for the 18200 do not get a sigma or tamron
br so the conclusion is i cant see any better value then nikon d50 nikon 18200 lense
i purchased a nikon d50 almost as an impulse when i saw the price and was prepared to be disappointed
all in all we are very dissapointed with nikon d50
the lens is 1855mm and i bought somes lenses that is nikon 50mm f18 nikon 85mm f18 and nikon 70300mmg which is very cheap and i would buy for my next lens is 1224mm i think my lens already completed
this is a really great camera for the enthusiastic amateur who does not want to stop and figure out f stops depth of field etc thus the d50 offers the photographer an alternative to pointandshoot cameras which also provide computerized exposure modes but it has more advanced electronics than most of them and most importantly it can utilize professional quality nikon lenses to which the lenses on most pocket cameras cannot really compare
just a quick note on this camera i investigated this camera as well as the canon d20 and the nikon d70 for about two months before i decided to buy it but now that i have it i couldnt be happier
if you have nikon already the d50 is great and you can probably use most if not all of your existing lenses on this body
br once i made up my mind to buy a nikon i compared the d70 to the d50
unless you are so experienced that you do not have to read a manual and im not i highly recommend you invest in a copy magic lantern guides nikon d50 by simon stafford
but but in the end i decided to get the d50 instead on the grounds that the nikon d50 body is better built and more pleasant to shoot with and has better noise performance at high iso
the d70s is more expensive but has a couple of newer features than the d70 as far as taking pictures goes the d70 and d70s are pretty much the same camera
when going for the nikon d50 i had the following things in mind
br the nikon d50 gives you all this plus a lot more it starts up in no time it is silent battery autonomy is ok it is speedy and takes at least 25 fps in full res
br i had a hard time figuring out the key differences between the nikon d70 and d50
i had been looking into buying a dslr for a few months and spent much of my time ponderingthe nikon d70 and the pentax ist ds for some reason i just sort of thought of the nikon d50 as the d70s cheap little brother boy was i wrong
we own a nikon d100 and lots of lenses but she found the d100 too complicated
i also have a nikon d100 digital camera and the d50 is about equal in quality to the more expensive camera
while newer cameras like the d90 and up into the way more expensive professional models current in 2010 have technically better image quality the d50 is kind of like a digital holga for me as any good photographer knows megapixels dont mean jack sh beyond getting somewhat more detail in huge printsa medium format film camera doesnt take inherently better images than a 35mm film camera unless there is an objective goal of more detail in the final large print

i think that this would have been included but it is not
i purchased this camera as a novice user wanting to learn more
i find that i use manual mode and auto equally in order to make sure i have the picture
makes you feel like you know what your doing
this is my first dslr camera
i ordered the xt with the efs 1855mm 3556 is lens for only around 180
after buying the 4 gb sandisk cf card i spent less than 700 total
a few years ago i would only be a able to buy a highend point and shoot camera
for traveling even fits in my backpack with my 1855mm is attached
1600 is ok
monochrome lcd display
for starting out in dslr photography and hotshoe for future external flash
and focus point display in viewfinder
br custom functions allow some tweaking
i wish the shortcut buttons just toggle through the settings and that i could see the resulting changes on the monochrome lcd
is too firm to easily rotate
this is the first digital camera after using a canon slr rebel for years
i had been looking for a long time
its purely a matter of taste when choosing between the four major players sony nikon
it has gone all over the world with me japan singapore mexico us london germany etc
used it once and its okay so i give the same rating
i bought the camera for my trip to palm springs
i havent found anything i dont like about this camera
the camera does not come with a memory card so you do have to buy that separatelyjust know that so you can get that before your camera arrives
he usado antes camaras canon y son muy buenas pero esta es una buena opcion para quienes inician en la fotografia profesional o fotografos mas avanzados
tiene 5 puntos de enfoque que se pueden manipular para lograr efectos muy buenos y una rafaga de disparos continuos de unos 12 disparos en unos 2a3 seg
como detalle tambien les aclaro que el lente efs 1855 que trae se queda corto para hacer acercamientos entonces tengan por seguro que tendran que adquirir otro lente
otras baterias tambien son otra buena opcion para comprar puesto que si usan mucho el screen para revisar las fotografias se consumen bastante rapido
bueno la verdad yo si la recomiendo
it is only for review
id suggest the canon 50mm f18 of f14 because with the kit lens you really wont be able to do much indoors
i purchased this camera on a whim because i thought that id like to dabble in photography a bit
br also consider shooting in raw format for you budding photographers because then you can go into photoshop and really see the full potential of a photograph
br also check out httpwwwusacanoncomcontentrebelxttutorialrebelxtlessonshtm
the basic info on f stops exposure white balance and much more
telescopic ones cost more and after buying a 500 dollar camera with a 60 dollar memory card and a 100 dollar tripod im kind of wiped out
ive wanted to purchase the canon digital rebel xt for more than 6 months and had been keeping my eye on the prices from both local and web stores
the camera arrived on time and in new unopend condition as advertised
but i purchased another xt to replace my wifes camera which was a canon 570
i paid can 1100 for my xt body in may of 2005 and now you can buy it with 1855 lens for 450
